    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Boursin, which is the brand name for a French style of cheese called Gournay cheese, is known for its creamy texture and garlicky flavor. It hails from Northern France, where it first gained popularity in the early '60s. Today, Boursin is a household name, and its versatility has made it a popular choice among cooks and creators on social media.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 5.2-oz package of Boursin Garlic & Fine Herbs Cheese</li>
        <li>1 head of garlic</li>
        <li>1 lemon, halved</li>
        <li>1 medium shallot, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb. dried pasta of your choice, cooked according to package instructions</li>
        <li>Lemon zest and crushed red pepper flakes for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Unwrap the Boursin cheese and place it in the center of an 8x8-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Cut the top off the garlic to expose the cloves and place in the dish, clove-side-up. Add the lemon halves, face down, and shallot to the dish. Sprinkle with black pepper and oregano and drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool for a few minutes. Using your hands or a handheld lemon press, squeeze the juice from the roasted lemon halves into the dish, taking care not to get any seeds in the dish. Squeeze the roasted garlic head to release the cloves into the dish.</li>
        <li>Mix all of the contents of the baking dish together until a smooth, creamy sauce forms.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked pasta to the baking dish and stir to coat. Serve topped with fresh lemon zest and crushed red pepper flakes, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
